The hallmark that Lisp's design was making parentheses optional for top-level invocation and supporting the pipe <code>|</code> character as an infix thread-first operator.</p> <p>PiLisp is a shortened form of \"Piped Lisp,\" because I set out to reimplement that underpowered Lisp with a proper approach, knowing that I could support its piping/expression-threading behavior via a macro, rather than by hard-coding it into the language implementation. As projects tend to do, PiLisp morphed from being a language that I intended to re-embed into the sc project into an independent language with interesting features in its own right. It became so far removed from the original project that it was not longer straightforward to drop it in as a replacement.</p>"},{"location":"install/","title":"Installation","text":""},{"location":"install/#executables","title":"Executables","text":"<p>Download a standalone executable for your platform from GitHub:</p> <p>PiLisp GitHub Releases</p> <p>macOS Users</p> <p>These executables are not signed.
